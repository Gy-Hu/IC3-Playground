#### Description
535 invariant checking problems (Verilog RTL files with SystemVerilog assertions, as well as in BTOR2 format) that can be classified as follows:

- **opensource:** 
A set of 141 problems collected from benchmark suites accompanying tools vcegar [1] (#23), v2c [2] (#32) and verilog2smv [3] (#86). Problems include cores from picoJava, USB 1.1, CRC generation, Huffman coding, mutual exclusion algorithms, simple microprocessor, etc.

- **industry:** 
A set of 370 problems collected from industrial collaborators. Of these, 124 were categorized as easy (named gen\*) (code sizes between 155 and 761 lines; # of flip-flops between 514 and 931), and 235 as challenging (named cal\*) (code sizes between 109 and 22065 lines; # of flip-flops between 6 and 7249). The remaining 11 problems (named mul\*) involved sequential equivalence checking on a multiplier design before and after clock gating optimization.

- **crafted:** 
A set of 24 simple problems synthetically created for calibration (includes both control- and data-centric problems) [4].
