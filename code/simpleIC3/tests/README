This directory contains a large number of mostly easy AIG-format instances for model checkers, intended for use in regression testing.
Many of these were produced by delta-debugging instances from the Hardware Model Checking Competition: http://fmv.jku.at/hwmcc10/
Others were produced through fuzz testing with aigfuzz: http://fmv.jku.at/aiger

These instances are *roughly* numbered by increasing difficulty.

Also included is the bash script test.sh, which can be useful for regression testing using these instances.
The script assumes you have runlim (http://fmv.jku.at/runlim/) and abc (http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/)
installed. It runs a given solver on each instance with a 5 second timelimit, stopping if any instance either crashes
the solver or disagrees with abc.

The script also uses aigfuzz to do fuzztesting.

Example usage:
$test.sh simpic3
