CS704 Assignment 3: Implementing PDR

In order to run all PDR examples run:

python test_pdr.py run_all

Output will be printed to the screen as well as written to files with names corresponding to the test cases.

Individual tests can be run as well:

python test_pdr.py <test>

The two longest tests on my machines are counter_unsat and add_sub_unsat.
Both of them took around a minute to solve, but probably on faster machines will take much less time.
The time it takes them to run can be increased by increasing the width of the bit vectors.
