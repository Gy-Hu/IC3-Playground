- use btor when possible
- when not needed, don't enunemrate model in solve (and use btor)

- assumptions : add to all frame ? (or add to transition?)
- array: blackbox ?
- variable set : too constrained? trial and error ?

- use init in sygus ? Yes. You must.

- fast solve using btor if model is not necessary

- over-approximation :
    drop cex that are too difficult (we may add them later if they are truly needed)
    
- synthesize new lemmas:
    don't use those that are difficult
    or just use that it should block (so we rely on the conjunction to do the work)
    need to take init => ITP into consideration in SyGuS!

- push lemma 
   do not do that hard to non property lemma?

- lemma status tracking

- test other designs (SP, vdp)

- var set heuristics (!!!)
- sygus-stream (!!!)
- var set decisions () --> sp/aes
- assumptions
- debug INT BV interpolant?
- break : dump frame
- push summary
- srem
- neg p on each frame
- block cex 's sygus
* module name etc: only leaves those with "m1."
